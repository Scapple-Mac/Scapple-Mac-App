# Scapple-Mac-App
**Scapple** is an innovative **idea mapping and freeform brainstorming tool** created by **Literature &amp; Latte**, the team behind Scrivener. It provides a flexible canvas where you can capture, connect, and rearrange thoughts visually â€” just like sketching ideas on a whiteboard, but smarter and cleaner.
