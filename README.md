## üí° Overview  

**Scapple** is an innovative **idea mapping and freeform brainstorming tool** created by **Literature & Latte**, the team behind Scrivener. It provides a flexible canvas where you can capture, connect, and rearrange thoughts visually ‚Äî just like sketching ideas on a whiteboard, but smarter and cleaner.  

Unlike conventional mind mapping software, **Scapple** allows you to **place notes anywhere** without enforcing strict hierarchies or rigid layouts. You can link related thoughts, create clusters of concepts, and move items freely as your ideas grow and evolve.  

Writers, researchers, and creative thinkers use **Scapple** to plan projects, map storylines, and organize complex ideas visually. Its integration with **Scrivener** allows users to export their maps directly into writing projects, bridging the gap between brainstorming and structured writing.  

With an uncluttered interface, customizable appearance, and intuitive controls, **Scapple** is designed to keep you focused on creativity rather than formatting. It‚Äôs the ultimate thinking companion for anyone who prefers freedom and visual flow in their creative process.
